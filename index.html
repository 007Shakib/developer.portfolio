            <p>I am a tech enthusiast and creative problem-solver. With a passion for all things tech, I enjoys
                exploring
                the latest gadgets, software, and innovations that are shaping the world around us. As a curious and
                detail-oriented individual, I am always seeking to understand the inner workings of technology and how
                it
                can be used to improve our lives.</p>

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
